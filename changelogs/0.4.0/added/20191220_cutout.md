# Cutout Augmenter #531 #570

* Added `imgaug.augmenters.arithmetic.apply_cutout_()`, which replaces
  in-place a single rectangular area with a constant intensity value or a
  constant color or gaussian noise.
  See also the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04552) about Cutout.
* Added `imgaug.augmenters.arithmetic.apply_cutout()`. Same as
  `apply_cutout_()`, but copies the input images before applying cutout.
* Added `imgaug.augmenters.arithmetic.Cutout`.
