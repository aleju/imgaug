# Added Identity #481

* [rarely breaking] Added `imgaug.augmenters.meta.Identity`, an alias of
  `Noop`. `Identity` is now the recommended augmenter for identity
  transformations. This change can break code that explicitly relied on
  exactly `Noop` being used, e.g. via `isinstance` checks.
* Renamed parameter `noop_if_topmost` to `identity_if_topmost` in
  method `imgaug.augmenters.meta.Augmenter.remove_augmenters()`. The old name
  is now deprecated.
