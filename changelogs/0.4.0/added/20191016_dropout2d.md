# New Dropout Augmenters #458

* Added a new augmenter `Dropout2d`, which drops channels in images with
  a defineable probability `p`. Dropped channels will be filled with zeros.
  By default, the augmenter keeps at least one channel in each image
  unaltered (i.e. not dropped).
* Added new augmenter `TotalDropout`, which sets all components to zero
  for `p` percent of all images. The augmenter should be used in connection
  with e.g. blend augmenters.
