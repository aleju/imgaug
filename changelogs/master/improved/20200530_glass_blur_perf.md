# Improved Performance of Glass Blur #683 #684

This patch improves the performance of
`imgaug.augmenters.imgcorruptplike.apply_glass_blur()`
and the corresponding augmenter in python 3.6+.
The improvement is around 14x to 45x, depending on
the image size (larger images have more speedup).

Added dependencies:
* `numba` (requires python 3.6+)
