# Support for Python 3.8 #600

The library is now tested in python 3.8 and compatible with that
version. The latest version of `Shapely` is required for that,
which can right now be installed via `pip install --pre Shapely`.
(Skipping the `--pre` currently leads to an older shapely version,
which causes an error during installation in python 3.8.)
