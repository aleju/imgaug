# About

This python library helps you with augmenting images for your machine learning projects.
It converts a set of input images into a new, much larger set of slightly altered images.

![64 quokkas](examples_grid.jpg?raw=true "64 quokkas")

Features:
* Most standard augmentation techniques available.
* Techniques can be applied to both images and keypoints/landmarks on images.
* Define your augmentation sequence once at the start of the experiment, then apply it many times.
* Define flexible stochastic ranges for each augmentation, e.g. "rotate each image by a value between -45 and 45 degrees" or "rotate each image by a value sampled from the normal distribution N(0, 5.0)".
* Easily convert all stochastic ranges to deterministic values to augment different batches of images in the exactly identical way (e.g. images and their heatmaps).

The image below shows examples for each availabe augmentation technique.

![Available augmenters](examples.jpg?raw=true "Effects of all available augmenters")

*Noop is an augmenter that does nothing. Values for crop are (top pixel, right px, bottom px, left px). Other values written in the form (a, b) mean that each value x was randomly picked from the range a <= x <= b.*

# Requirements and installation

Required packages:
* six
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-image (`pip install -U scikit-image`)
* OpenCV (i.e. `cv2`)

OpenCV has to be manually installed. The other package should auto-install themselves.

To install, simply use `sudo pip install imgaug`. That version might be outdated though. To always get the newest version directly from github use `sudo pip install git+https://github.com/aleju/imgaug`.
Alternatively, you can download the repository via `git clone https://github.com/aleju/imgaug` and install by using `python setup.py sdist && sudo pip install dist/imgaug-0.2.2b.tar.gz`.

To deinstall the library, just execute `sudo pip uninstall imgaug`.

The library is currently only tested in python2.7, but the code is written so that it *should* run in python3 too.

# Examples

A standard machine learning situation.
Train on batches of images and augment each batch via crop, horizontal flip ("Fliplr") and gaussian blur:
```python
from imgaug import augmenters as iaa

seq = iaa.Sequential([
    iaa.Crop(px=(0, 16)), # crop images from each side by 0 to 16px (randomly chosen)
    iaa.Fliplr(0.5), # horizontally flip 50% of the images
    iaa.GaussianBlur(sigma=(0, 3.0)) # blur images with a sigma of 0 to 3.0
])

for batch_idx in range(1000):
    # 'images' should be either a 4D numpy array of shape (N, height, width, channels)
    # or a list of 3D numpy arrays, each having shape (height, width, channels).
    # Grayscale images must have shape (height, width, 1) each.
    # All images must have numpy's dtype uint8. Values are expected to be in
    # range 0-255.
    images = load_batch(batch_idx)
    images_aug = seq.augment_images(images)
    train_on_images(images_aug)
```

Apply heavy augmentations to images (used to create the image at the very top of this readme):
```python
import imgaug as ia
from imgaug import augmenters as iaa
import numpy as np

# random example images
images = np.random.randint(0, 255, (16, 128, 128, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

# Sometimes(0.5, ...) applies the given augmenter in 50% of all cases,
# e.g. Sometimes(0.5, GaussianBlur(0.3)) would blur roughly every second image.
sometimes = lambda aug: iaa.Sometimes(0.5, aug)

# Define our sequence of augmentation steps that will be applied to every image
# All augmenters with per_channel=0.5 will sample one value _per image_
# in 50% of all cases. In all other cases they will sample new values
# _per channel_.
seq = iaa.Sequential(
    [
        # apply the following augmenters to most images
        iaa.Fliplr(0.5), # horizontally flip 50% of all images
        iaa.Flipud(0.2), # vertically flip 20% of all images
        sometimes(iaa.Crop(percent=(0, 0.1))), # crop images by 0-10% of their height/width
        sometimes(iaa.Affine(
            scale={"x": (0.8, 1.2), "y": (0.8, 1.2)}, # scale images to 80-120% of their size, individually per axis
            translate_percent={"x": (-0.2, 0.2), "y": (-0.2, 0.2)}, # translate by -20 to +20 percent (per axis)
            rotate=(-45, 45), # rotate by -45 to +45 degrees
            shear=(-16, 16), # shear by -16 to +16 degrees
            order=[0, 1], # use nearest neighbour or bilinear interpolation (fast)
            cval=(0, 255), # if mode is constant, use a cval between 0 and 255
            mode=ia.ALL # use any of scikit-image's warping modes (see 2nd image from the top for examples)
        )),
        # execute 0 to 5 of the following (less important) augmenters per image
        # don't execute all of them, as that would often be way too strong
        iaa.SomeOf((0, 5),
            [
                sometimes(iaa.Superpixels(p_replace=(0, 1.0), n_segments=(20, 200))), # convert images into their superpixel representation
                iaa.OneOf([
                    iaa.GaussianBlur((0, 3.0)), # blur images with a sigma between 0 and 3.0
                    iaa.AverageBlur(k=(2, 7)), # blur image using local means with kernel sizes between 2 and 7
                    iaa.MedianBlur(k=(3, 11)), # blur image using local medians with kernel sizes between 2 and 7
                ]),
                iaa.Sharpen(alpha=(0, 1.0), lightness=(0.75, 1.5)), # sharpen images
                iaa.Emboss(alpha=(0, 1.0), strength=(0, 2.0)), # emboss images
                # search either for all edges or for directed edges
                sometimes(iaa.OneOf([
                    iaa.EdgeDetect(alpha=(0, 0.7)),
                    iaa.DirectedEdgeDetect(alpha=(0, 0.7), direction=(0.0, 1.0)),
                ])),
                iaa.AdditiveGaussianNoise(loc=0, scale=(0.0, 0.05*255), per_channel=0.5), # add gaussian noise to images
                iaa.OneOf([
                    iaa.Dropout((0.01, 0.1), per_channel=0.5), # randomly remove up to 10% of the pixels
                    iaa.CoarseDropout((0.03, 0.15), size_percent=(0.02, 0.05), per_channel=0.2),
                ]),
                iaa.Invert(0.05, per_channel=True), # invert color channels
                iaa.Add((-10, 10), per_channel=0.5), # change brightness of images (by -10 to 10 of original value)
                iaa.Multiply((0.5, 1.5), per_channel=0.5), # change brightness of images (50-150% of original value)
                iaa.ContrastNormalization((0.5, 2.0), per_channel=0.5), # improve or worsen the contrast
                iaa.Grayscale(alpha=(0.0, 1.0)),
                sometimes(iaa.ElasticTransformation(alpha=(0.5, 3.5), sigma=0.25)) # move pixels locally around (with random strengths)
            ],
            random_order=True
        )
    ],
    random_order=True
)

images_aug = seq.augment_images(images)
```

Quickly show example results of your augmentation sequence:
```python
from imgaug import augmenters as iaa
import numpy as np

images = np.random.randint(0, 255, (16, 128, 128, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
seq = iaa.Sequential([iaa.Fliplr(0.5), iaa.GaussianBlur((0, 3.0))])

# show an image with 8*8 augmented versions of image 0
seq.show_grid(images[0], cols=8, rows=8)

# Show an image with 8*8 augmented versions of image 0 and 8*8 augmented
# versions of image 1. The identical augmentations will be applied to
# image 0 and 1.
seq.show_grid([images[0], images[1]], cols=8, rows=8)
```

Augment two batches of images in *exactly the same way* (e.g. horizontally flip 1st, 2nd and 5th images in both batches, but do not alter 3rd and 4th images):
```python
from imgaug import augmenters as iaa

# Standard scenario: You have N RGB-images and additionally 21 heatmaps per image.
# You want to augment each image and its heatmaps identically.
images = np.random.randint(0, 255, (16, 128, 128, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
heatmaps = np.random.randint(0, 255, (16, 128, 128, 21), dtype=np.uint8)

seq = iaa.Sequential([iaa.GaussianBlur((0, 3.0)), iaa.Affine(translate_px={"x": (-40, 40)})])

# Convert the stochastic sequence of augmenters to a deterministic one.
# The deterministic sequence will always apply the exactly same effects to the images.
seq_det = seq.to_deterministic() # call this for each batch again, NOT only once at the start
images_aug = seq_det.augment_images(images)
heatmaps_aug = seq_det.augment_images(heatmaps)
```

Augment images *and* landmarks on these images:
```python
import imgaug as ia
from imgaug import augmenters as iaa
from scipy import misc
import random
import numpy as np
images = np.random.randint(0, 50, (4, 128, 128, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

# Generate random keypoints.
# The augmenters expect a list of imgaug.KeypointsOnImage.
keypoints_on_images = []
for image in images:
    height, width = image.shape[0:2]
    keypoints = []
    for _ in range(4):
        x = random.randint(0, width-1)
        y = random.randint(0, height-1)
        keypoints.append(ia.Keypoint(x=x, y=y))
    keypoints_on_images.append(ia.KeypointsOnImage(keypoints, shape=image.shape))

seq = iaa.Sequential([iaa.GaussianBlur((0, 3.0)), iaa.Affine(scale=(0.5, 0.7))])
seq_det = seq.to_deterministic() # call this for each batch again, NOT only once at the start

# augment keypoints and images
images_aug = seq_det.augment_images(images)
keypoints_aug = seq_det.augment_keypoints(keypoints_on_images)

# Example code to show each image and print the new keypoints coordinates
for img_idx, (image_before, image_after, keypoints_before, keypoints_after) in enumerate(zip(images, images_aug, keypoints_on_images, keypoints_aug)):
    image_before = keypoints_before.draw_on_image(image_before)
    image_after = keypoints_after.draw_on_image(image_after)
    misc.imshow(np.concatenate((image_before, image_after), axis=1)) # before and after
    for kp_idx, keypoint in enumerate(keypoints_after.keypoints):
        keypoint_old = keypoints_on_images[img_idx].keypoints[kp_idx]
        x_old, y_old = keypoint_old.x, keypoint_old.y
        x_new, y_new = keypoint.x, keypoint.y
        print("[Keypoints for image #%d] before aug: x=%d y=%d | after aug: x=%d y=%d" % (img_idx, x_old, y_old, x_new, y_new))
```

Apply single augmentations to images:
```python
from imgaug import augmenters as iaa
import numpy as np
images = np.random.randint(0, 255, (16, 128, 128, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

flipper = iaa.Fliplr(1.0) # always horizontally flip each input image
images[0] = flipper.augment_image(images[0]) # horizontally flip image 0

vflipper = iaa.Flipud(0.9) # vertically flip each input image with 90% probability
images[1] = vflipper.augment_image(images[1]) # probably vertically flip image 1

blurer = iaa.GaussianBlur(3.0)
images[2] = blurer.augment_image(images[2]) # blur image 2 by a sigma of 3.0
images[3] = blurer.augment_image(images[3]) # blur image 3 by a sigma of 3.0 too

translater = iaa.Affine(translate_px={"x": -16}) # move each input image by 16px to the left
images[4] = translater.augment_image(images[4]) # move image 4 to the left

scaler = iaa.Affine(scale={"y": (0.8, 1.2)}) # scale each input image to 80-120% on the y axis
images[5] = scaler.augment_image(images[5]) # scale image 5 by 80-120% on the y axis
```

Apply an augmenter to only specific image channels:
```python
from imgaug import augmenters as iaa
import numpy as np

# fake RGB images
images = np.random.randint(0, 255, (16, 128, 128, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

# add a random value from the range (-30, 30) to the first two channels of
# input images (e.g. to the R and G channels)
aug = iaa.WithChannels(
  channels=[0, 1],
  children=iaa.Add((-30, 30))
)

images_aug = aug.augment_images(images)
```

You can use more unusual distributions for the stochastic parameters of each augmenter:
```python
from imgaug import augmenters as iaa
from imgaug import parameters as iap
import numpy as np
images = np.random.randint(0, 255, (16, 128, 128, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

# Blur by a value sigma which is sampled from a uniform distribution
# of range 0.1 <= x < 3.0.
# The convenience shortcut for this is: iaa.GaussianBlur((0.1, 3.0))
blurer = iaa.GaussianBlur(iap.Uniform(0.1, 3.0))
images_aug = blurer.augment_images(images)

# Blur by a value sigma which is sampled from a normal distribution N(1.0, 0.1),
# i.e. sample a value that is usually around 1.0.
# Clip the resulting value so that it never gets below 0.1 or above 3.0.
blurer = iaa.GaussianBlur(iap.Clip(iap.Normal(1.0, 0.1), 0.1, 3.0))
images_aug = blurer.augment_images(images)

# Same again, but this time the mean of the normal distribution is not constant,
# but comes itself from a uniform distribution between 0.5 and 1.5.
blurer = iaa.GaussianBlur(iap.Clip(iap.Normal(iap.Uniform(0.5, 1.5), 0.1), 0.1, 3.0))
images_aug = blurer.augment_images(images)

# Use for sigma one of exactly three allowed values: 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5.
blurer = iaa.GaussianBlur(iap.Choice([0.5, 1.0, 1.5]))
images_aug = blurer.augment_images(images)

# Sample sigma from a discrete uniform distribution of range 1 <= sigma <= 5,
# i.e. sigma will have any of the following values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
blurer = iaa.GaussianBlur(iap.DiscreteUniform(1, 5))
images_aug = blurer.augment_images(images)
```

You can dynamically deactivate augmenters in an already defined sequence:
```python
import imgaug as ia
from imgaug import augmenters as iaa
import numpy as np

# images and heatmaps, just arrays filled with value 30
images = np.ones((16, 128, 128, 3), dtype=np.uint8) * 30
heatmaps = np.ones((16, 128, 128, 21), dtype=np.uint8) * 30

# add vertical lines to see the effect of flip
images[:, 16:128-16, 120:124, :] = 120
heatmaps[:, 16:128-16, 120:124, :] = 120

seq = iaa.Sequential([
  iaa.Fliplr(0.5, name="Flipper"),
  iaa.GaussianBlur((0, 3.0), name="GaussianBlur"),
  iaa.Dropout(0.02, name="Dropout"),
  iaa.AdditiveGaussianNoise(scale=0.01*255, name="MyLittleNoise"),
  iaa.AdditiveGaussianNoise(loc=32, scale=0.0001*255, name="SomeOtherNoise"),
  iaa.Affine(translate_px={"x": (-40, 40)}, name="Affine")
])

# change the activated augmenters for heatmaps,
# we only want to execute horizontal flip, affine transformation and one of
# the gaussian noises
def activator_heatmaps(images, augmenter, parents, default):
    if augmenter.name in ["GaussianBlur", "Dropout", "MyLittleNoise"]:
        return False
    else:
        # default value for all other augmenters
        return default
hooks_heatmaps = ia.HooksImages(activator=activator_heatmaps)

seq_det = seq.to_deterministic() # call this for each batch again, NOT only once at the start
images_aug = seq_det.augment_images(images)
heatmaps_aug = seq_det.augment_images(heatmaps, hooks=hooks_heatmaps)
```
